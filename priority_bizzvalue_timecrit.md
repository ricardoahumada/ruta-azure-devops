# **Priority, Business Value, Time Criticality**

## Priority

- **1**: Highest priority, implement feature or fix as soon as possible. Product cannot ship without successful resolution.
- **2**: Medium priority. Product cannot ship without successful resolution, but it does not need to be addressed immediately.
- **3**: Low priority. Implementation or fix is optional based on resources, time, and risk. If product ships without successful resolution, document the issue in release notes as known issues.
